TODO : Why The Client Program ends after just few seconds 
(It needs that before opening me the server should be already open) !!



We added Keyboard All Events (Pressed + Type + Released)
AS well as Mouse Events (mouse movement & scroll events - Mouse Clicks (Right + Left))


Keyloggers typically use symmetric encryption methods, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to encrypt captured keystrokes.
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption

Window Title Tracking
Detect which application/window is currently active when a key is pressed.
Example: "User typed 'abc' in Google Chrome – Window: 'YouTube - Chrome'".
This adds context to your logs.

Clipboard Monitoring
Capture copy-paste events (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V) and log clipboard content.
Useful for catching sensitive data. (⚠ Only for ethical/authorized usage!)

Screenshot on Trigger
Take a screenshot whenever:
User presses Enter
Mouse click happens in a specific window
Certain keyword is typed (like "password" or "login")
Send the screenshot to the server for visual context.

Log time and date for each key press.

Keystroke Burst Compression
Instead of sending every single key in real time, store them in a buffer and send in chunks.
Reduces network load and makes logs cleaner.

Keyword Alerts
If certain keywords are typed ("admin", "root", "bank"), trigger an instant alert to the server.

Idle Time Detection
Detect when the user is inactive (no keyboard/mouse events for X seconds) and send an “Idle” status.
Useful for behavioral analysis.

9. Multi-threaded Event Handling
Use separate threads for:
Keyboard events
Mouse events
Network sending

Prevents lag if one task is slow.

10. Data Encryption Before Sending
Encrypt keystrokes and mouse logs before sending to the server.

Even if intercepted, data stays secure.
